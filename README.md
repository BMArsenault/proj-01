## User Story

AS a person who loves to travel and hike in new places,
I WANT an app/website that I can visit to discover hiking/trails
SO THAT I can find local hiking locations and be aware of the current weather.

HIKE SPOT allows a user to search for the nearest hiking trails by inputting their current location. A built-in weather app details the current weather conditions.
When traveling, you might not be familiar with local hiking locations. HIKE SPOT is here to help!
